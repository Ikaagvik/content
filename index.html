										<h2>Ikaaġvik Sikukun</h2>
										<p style="font-style:italic;top:-10px;">"Ice bridges"</p>
									</header>
									<p style="text-align:justify;">Ikaaġvik  Sikukun  is  a  research  project  that  couples  state-of-the-art  geophysical  observations  from  unmanned  aerial  systems  (UAS)  with  a  community-engaged  research  approach  to  bridge  scientific  and  indigenous  understanding  of  sea  ice  change  in  the  Alaska  Arctic.    Our  research  team  represents  a  partnership  between  academic  researchers  and  the  Native  Village  of  Kotzebue  and  includes  expertise  in  ice  and  ocean  physics,  marine  biology,  ethnography  and  documentary  filmmaking.  The  research  will  take  place  in  and  around  the  community  of  Kotzebue,  Alaska,  which  lies  within  Kotzebue  Sound  on  the  coast  of  southern  Chukchi  Sea.  Sea  ice  is  integral  to  the  way  of  life  for  Kotzebue’s  indigenous  residents  who  rely  on  the  marine  mammals  that  inhabit  the  ice  pack  for  food  and  clothing.  Our  study  plan  begins  and  ends  with  the  involvement  of  community  members  to  help  craft  research  questions,  collect  observations  and  synthesize  our  findings.  Ultimately,  the  findings  will  contribute  to  predictive  assessments  of  the  changing  cryosphere  of  Kotzebue  Sound,  the  implications  of  such  change  for  the  ecology  and  the  Iñupiaq  way  of  life  that  is  dependent  upon  it.  Through  this  approach,  we  will  address  key  questions  concerning  the  mechanisms  and  impacts  of  rapid  changes  taking  place  in  the  Arctic  while  ensuring  that  our  answers  incorporate  traditional  ways  of  knowing  and  are  relevant  to  local  needs. </p>

												<p>Cyrus is a lifelong coastal Alaskan, living mostly at Sisualik, about 12 miles across the bay from Kotzebue. He learned from a young age the importance of keeping track of the ice when the weather changed and how and when the ice is taken out. His people rely heavily on caribou, fish, waterfoul, and especially sea mammals. He hunts for bearded seal, ring seal and spotted seal, which requires that he studies and keeps track of the sea ice when it's first forming in fall time, during the winter months for overflow, when land fast ice is created, and when the nearest leads are created for seal hunting.</br>
												<br>Cyrus runs Maniilaq Association's Hunter Support Program, which provides fish and game to elders. He also helped to establish a traditional food donation center and food storage facility called the Siġḷauq. Not only does he hunt, gather and fish for his family, but he also supplies this program with a lot of it's subsistence foods, which keeps him very active in activities across Kotzebue Sound throughout the year by boat, dog team, and snow-machine.</br>
												<br>He is also involved in the Western Arctic Caribou Herd Working Group, the Alaska Beluga Whale Committee, the Inuit Circumpolar Council-Alaska, and with Alaska Fish and Game Advisory Committee.</p>

												<p>Scott is an electronics and systems engineer who works with Dr.
Christopher Zappa to perform both traditional and cutting-edge measurements
from UAVs. For the last 6 years and across 3 different projects, he and a small team
of engineers have evolved the design, construction, and operation of multiple UAV
science payloads based on the overarching goals coordinated by Dr. Zappa. These
goals inform a wide breadth of ocean surface sciences, from the physics of heat and
gas transfer to the varying colors produced by biological and chemical processes.

												<p>Nathan is a post-doctoral research scientist at Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory of Columbia University. He was raised in Maine and has lived by the
coast his entire life, captivated by the sea. Nathan received his Ph.D. in Applied
Marine Physics from the University of Miami in December of 2016. His graduate
research was centered around ocean surface gravity-capillary waves (wavelengths
of order one centimeter) and the role they play in mediating physical air-sea
interaction. In the course of this work, he was able to spend a good amount of time
at sea in the Gulf of Mexico observing near-surface material transport patterns,
effort which was primarily motivated by the interest in understanding the transport
of spilled oil. He is very excited to apply his understanding of air-sea interaction
physics towards describing sea ice breakup, especially through the unique lens that
Ikaaġvik Sikukun provides.</p>

										Latitude Engineering’s HQ-90B aircraft represents a giant leap in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) capability, enabling long-endurance missions with vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL)
and optimized to perform in remote locations such as Alaska’s Arctic coastal communities. The
Hybrid Quadrotor (HQ) technology offers the efficiency, speed, and range of a normal fixed-
wing aircraft with no need for a runway or other complex launch and recovery equipment.
The HQ-90B has a cruising speed of 40 knots, with a 15-hour endurance carrying a nominal
15-lb payload. The HQ-90B can reach 14,000 feet, has a wingspan of 185 inches and weighs
115 lb. The aircraft features a swappable nose cone for holding a variety of payloads that can be
switched out quickly. Compared to pure multi-rotors, HQ technology is more cost effective,
more reliable, has higher top speed, more endurance, more wind tolerance, and can cover more
ground. Compared to fixed wing aircraft, HQ technology operates from more locations and from
more types of platforms.
